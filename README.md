oculus-rift
================

vr.js, three.js, physi.js, leap motion, all amalgamated into something... different. A simple archery minigame, 
as it turns out.


Controls
--------
The Rift controls head orientation, and the movement of the player is automatic. All that's left is the fire 
button, Spacebar.
