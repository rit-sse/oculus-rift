oculus-rift
================

vr.js, three.js, physi.js, leap motion, all amalgamated into something... different. A simple archery minigame, 
as it turns out.

Setup
------
Simply open the webpage in Chrome, and fullscreen the page on the Rift's display. Make sure you have the 
[vr.js](https://github.com/benvanik/vr.js) 
extension installed. or the Rift won't be recognized by Chrome. 

If you want to use the LEAP Motion (I don't actually reccomend it, its response fidelity was poor in my tests, 
but I only tested on a low-spec system) simply have it on and the drivers installed. Move your hand into and out 
of the sensor's range to fire. (For example, hold the sensor in one hand, place the other near it, then draw 
back until it fires)


Controls
--------
The Rift controls head orientation, and the movement of the player is automatic. All that's left is the fire 
button, Spacebar.
